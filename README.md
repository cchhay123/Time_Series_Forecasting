# Time Series Forecasting Assignments

This repository highlights my knowledge and application of time series forecasting using the **forecast** package in R. Below are details from my coursework demonstrating these skills:

## Week 1: Time Series Data Exploration

- **Time Series Objects**: Creating and visualizing time series objects.
- **Initial Visualization**: Basic plotting techniques to identify patterns like trends and seasonality.

*Goal*: Establish familiarity with time series data structure and initial analysis.

---

## Week 3: Forecasting with Regression Models

- **Regression-based Forecasting**: Implemented the `tslm()` function for trend and seasonal components.
- **SNaive Forecasting**: Explored seasonal naive methods using `snaive()`.
- **Accuracy Measures**: Used accuracy metrics to evaluate forecasts.

*Goal*: Understand regression techniques in forecasting and basic evaluation metrics.

## Week 5: Advanced Forecasting with ARIMA and ETS Models

- **ARIMA Models**: Applied `auto.arima()` and manually configured ARIMA models (`Arima()`), including models with logarithmic transformations.
- **ETS Models**: Utilized Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (`ets()`) for forecasting.
- **Forecast Evaluation**: Extensive use of the `accuracy()` function to assess model performance.
- **Forecast Visualization**: Created forecasts and visualizations for comprehensive insight.

*Goal*: Gain advanced skills in ARIMA and ETS forecasting techniques, enhancing accuracy and model performance.
